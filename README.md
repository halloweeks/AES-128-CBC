# AES-128-OneKey-CBC
"AES-128-OneKey-CBC" is a unique cryptographic mode based on AES-128, employing a single key for encryption and decryption. The mode generates a distinctive initialization vector (IV) from the last round key during the key schedule, ensuring a uniquely secure process without requiring a separate IV key.
